This set provides facebook, twitter, rss and youtube feed wall for your site. Most sensible way of using it is to place facebook.php, twitter.php, rss.php and youtube.php somewhere in cron, so they can grab new feeds in background for instance each five minutes. Cron files cache results and store them in data folder. Cached data are serialized. File ajax.php is called asynchronously to take those serialized data and fill each of social tabs with cached feeds. Again this happens immediately, without affecting page load time. Some screenshots are attached to this repository
