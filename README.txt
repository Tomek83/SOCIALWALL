This set provides facebook, twitter, rss and youtube feed wall for your site. Be sure to place all files from cron folder somewhere in your crontab file, so they can grab new feeds in background for instance each five minutes. Cron files cache results and store them in data folder. Cached data are serialized. File ajax.php is called asynchronously to take those serialized data and fill each of social tabs with cached feeds. This happens immediately, without affecting page load time. Some screenshots are attached to this repository
